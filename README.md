# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis
Sentiment analysis extracts insights from text by assessing opinions and emotions. It preprocesses text, identifies features, and uses ML algorithms like Naive Bayes or SVM to classify sentiment. Evaluation metrics ensure model reliability for decision-making based on text sentiment.

Introduction :
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a powerful tool that enables us to extract valuable insights from text data. By analyzing the opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in written language, we can better understand people's perspectives and make informed decisions.To perform sentiment analysis, we first need to preprocess the text by removing unwanted information and normalizing the words. This helps to ensure that our analysis is based on relevant features and attributes. Next, we need to identify the features or attributes that are most relevant to the sentiment analysis. This can be done using various techniques, such as bag of words, n-grams, or word embeddings. By extracting these features, we can build a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral. To achieve this, we can use a variety of machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks. These algorithms are trained on a labeled dataset of text data with known sentiments, which enables them to learn how to accurately classify new text . Finally, we evaluate the performance of our model using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. By doing so, we can ensure that our model is accurate and reliable, and can be used to make informed decisions based on the sentiment of the text. Overall, sentiment analysis is a powerful tool that can help us gain valuable insights from text data and make more informed decisions based on people's opinions, emotions, and attitudes
